      <section class="right__align-box">
        <div class="inner about">
          <h3>Who Is J.P.?</h3>
          <p>J.P. falls into the category of the world's most unique and
            radical individuals.</p>

          <blockquote>One of God's own prototypes. A high-powered mutant
            of some kind never even considered for mass production. Too
            weird to live, and too rare to die.<br>
            - Hunter S. Thompson
          </blockquote>

          <p>Hailing from a small town in Texas, J.P. started rock climbing
            and wakeboarding at a very young age. He also took up snowboarding.
            It was clear that he enjoyed taking moderate risks and focusing on
            nothing in life except having as much fun as possible, all day
            e'rrrry day. He has had a thirst for life since birth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fast-forward to his '20s, and J.P. decided it was time to up the
            game, so he signed up for what's known as 'Accelerated freefall',
            or AFF for short. This is the program where you learn how to
            skydive. After about 8 jumps with instructors by your side, they
            turn you loose into the sky on your own and let you do your solo
            jumps until you reach jump number 25, at which point you go up and
            do a final check dive with an instructor. You do a series of
            maneuvers and if you perform all of them, in a safe manner, you
            earn yourself a USPA 'A' license, which means you are a big bad
            skydiver and can jump with your own gear, with other people, at
            any dropzone in the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, things got real. J.P. started BASE jumping full on stoke
            mode, with zero holding back. Over the course of a few years J.P.
            racked up over 300 BASE jumps, including all the categories
            of BASE (buildings, antenna towers, bridges (spans), earth). In the
            videos section below, you can see J.P. nonchalantly break his
            shinbone on a perfectly normal jump off the Perrine Bridge in
            Twin Falls, ID. Without needing to say, a little broken bone has
            not stopped him from sending it full time.
          </p>
          <p>
            When not throwing himself out of airplanes, or off the beautiful
            cliffs of Moab, UT, or discovering unopened exit points from
            gorgeous cliffs in the Rocky Mountains, J.P. has been a bit of a
            slacklining protege for the last 2 years, learning how to rig
            slacklines and to build funky space nets with all kinds of
            rock climbing rope and hardware.
